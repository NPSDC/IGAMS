We have tried two different MKL (Multiple Kernel Learning) approaches - Group Lasso and BEMKL for integrating data across different platforms, the code for which has been taken and adapted from the following two repositories:

Bayesian Efficient Multiple Kernel Learning - <https://github.com/mehmetgonen/bemkl>  
Group Lasso - <https://github.com/mehmetgonen/gsbc>
