# IGAMS - Integrated Models for Gene Expression and DNA Methylation for Cancer Stage Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of the models demonstrated in the paper
"**Integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression in Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma**".

We have tried two different MKL (Multiple Kernel Learning) approaches - Group Lasso and BEMKL for integrating data across different platforms, the code for which has been taken and adapted from the following two repositories:
